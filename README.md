# neovim-configs

## PreRequisites

This is basically my ~/.config/nvim directory

I'm running the nightly build of [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
([ppa](https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/unstable))

Plain neovim is nice, but [there are many different UI's available](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Related-projects#gui)
The GUI I'm currently using is [neovim-gtk](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-gtk)

## Language Servers

For an LSP client, I'm using [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

I will likely add others but metals is what drew my interest into LSP/vim to
see what it was like.

### Scala

For Scala, I'm using [metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vim.html)
